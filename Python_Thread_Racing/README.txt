THREAD RACING README
BY MARK DIVELBISS [SKOLLSEYE@GMAIL.COM]

Description:
The goal of this project was to display ability to code in Python using the standard library.
The project uses multithreading and random rolls to allow the threads to "race" against each other and display the results.
Each thread progresses through stages by rolling a d6 dice and maxing their roll, otherwise they lose time and have to try again.

Files:
1. Thread_Racing.py
---Python file that can be executed using a standard python3 interpreter.
---The program runs automatically based on preset constants in the program which can be changed in any text editor.
---Once a thread has reached the last stage, a winner is announced and the program ends execution.
2. README.txt
---This file is intended to help guide and shed light on this project.
